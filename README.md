# Simulation of an epidemic outbreak an a quarantine on graphs

Simulation of epidemic created for my article at Medium: COVID-19:
How the mechanics of flattening the curve work?

The idea of the simulation is to show the influence of quarantine on
epidemy spread curve. For details, please visit the article.

*Les Miserables* graph used in the simulation is copied from one of the 
[d3 plugins](https://github.com/d3/d3-plugins/blob/master/graph/data/miserables.json).
